# Soccer game

## Dependencies

The only library this project uses is [p5.js](https://p5js.org/). Served with a CDN so this thing doesn't get too big. (p5 isn't that big but helps reduce space anyway)

## Structure

Main page is at `index.html`, all scripts are in the `js` folder, and css lies in the `css` folder.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to make a pull request or an issue. I might not have time to handle all of these quickly, so expect 6-8 weeks before your pull request is handled.

## License

Figured I might as well add a license even if it's too early. This project is licensed under the MIT license.

## Future plans (for reference)

- Multiplayer support (big project, requires server)
- Better local storage saving
- Better AI
- Custom movement keys (for users with different keyboard layouts)

## ~~Bugs~~ Features

- AI can still be controlled with arrow keys
- Add a favicon and OpenGraph meta tags
